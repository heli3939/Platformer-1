## **üõ†Ô∏è Git Commit Log Instructions**
This section explains how students can automatically **generate a Git commit log** and save it in a file named after their **student number**.

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Prerequisites**
- Git must be installed on your system.
- You must be inside a **Git repository** (a project that has been initialized with Git).
- This works on **Linux, macOS, and Windows (WSL)**.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ How to Run the Bash Script**
#### **For Linux/macOS**
1. **Open a Terminal**: Navigate to the directory:
   ```sh
   cd /path/to/your/git/repo
   ```
2. **Grant Execution Permission**:
   ```sh
   chmod +x generate_git_log.sh
   ```
3. **Run the Script**:
   ```sh
   ./generate_git_log.sh
   ```
4. **Enter Your Student Number**: You will be prompted to enter it.
5. **View the Generated Log File**: A file `STUDENT_NUMBER.txt` will be created in the same directory.

#### **For Windows (WSL)**
1. **Enable WSL (If Not Installed)**:
   ```sh
   wsl --install
   ```
2. **Open WSL and Navigate to the Repository**:
   ```sh
   cd /mnt/c/path/to/your/git/repo
   ```
3. **Follow the Linux/macOS Steps Above**.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Example Output (`12345678.txt`)**
```
a1b2c3d - John Doe, 3 days ago : Initial commit
d4e5f6g - Alice Smith, 1 hour ago : Fixed a bug
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Troubleshooting**
#### **üõë "This is not a Git repository" Error**
If you see this error:
```sh
‚ùå Error: This is not a Git repository. Please navigate to your Git project directory.
```
Make sure you are inside a Git-tracked project:
```sh
git status
```
If Git is not initialized, run:
```sh
git init
```

#### **üõë "Permission Denied" Error**
If you get a permission error, use:
```sh
chmod +x generate_git_log.sh
./generate_git_log.sh
```
